# AGoT

This repository contains the code for [Soft-Prompting with Graph-of-Thought for Multi-modal Representation Learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2404.04538). We build AGoT on top of the awesome toolbox of [Dassl.pytorch](https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/Dassl.pytorch).


## How to Run

Install `dassl` based on https://github.com/KaiyangZhou/CoOp?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-install

Run AGoT on imagenet

```bash
sh scripts/AGoT/train.sh
```
